You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur-king, you and all your silly English kaniggets.  Thppppt! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough whopper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of eldeberries. No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a!
